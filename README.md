# Hypochondriax

You’re sick! And you don’t know what you have…
But your doctors are doing everything they can to help you! Their solution? Prescribe all possible drugs until you heal!
Everyday is a painful and infinite ritual of medicine, but be careful! The prescriptions change everyday and your doctors don’t have the prettiest writing...
Plus, some of your pills could have some disturbing side effects!
